"There is simply no credible way to address climate change without changing the way we get from here to there, meaning cars, trucks, planes and any other gas-guzzling forms of transportation. That is why it is so heartening to see electric cars, considered curios for the rich or eccentric or both not that long ago, now entering the mainstream.A slew of recent announcements by researchers, auto companies and world leaders offer real promise. First up, a forecast by Bloomberg New Energy Finance said that electric cars would become cheaper than conventional cars without government subsidies between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, auto companies like Tesla, General Motors and Volvo are planning a slate of new models that they say will be not only more affordable but also more practical than earlier versions. And officials in such countries as France, India and Norway have set aggressive targets for putting these vehicles to use and phasing out emission-spewing gasoline and diesel cars.Skeptics may see these announcements as wishful thinking. After all, just 1.1 percent of all cars sold globally in 2016 were electrics or plug-in hybrids. And many popular models still cost much more than comparable fossil-fuel cars.The skeptics, however, have consistently been overly pessimistic about this technology. Electric cars face challenges, yet they have caught on much faster than was thought likely just a few years ago. There were two million of them on the world’s roads last year, up 60 percent from 2015, according to the International Energy Agency. The cost of batteries, the single most expensive component of the cars, fell by more than half between 2012 and 2016, according to the Department of Energy. Tesla has indicated that it can produce batteries for about $125 per kilowatt-hour. Researchers say the cost of electric cars will be at parity with conventional vehicles when battery prices reach $100 per kilowatt-hour, which experts say is just a few years away. Electric cars are more efficient, of course, but they also require less maintenance, which should make them cheaper to own over time.The potential environmental benefits of electric vehicles are huge. The transportation sector accounts for 14 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and 27 percent of emissions in the United States. Moreover, countries have found it much more difficult to reduce planet-warming gases from transportation than from power plants. In America, for example, transportation emissions again regularly exceed those from the electricity sector for the first time since the late 1970s. The switch to electric cars is good for the climate because petroleum vehicles produce more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than power plants fueled by natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration.Proponents say the growth of electric cars, when combined with the surge in renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, could lead to big reductions in emissions over time. These forces should also help reduce local air pollution in countries like China and India, which is why their leaders are getting behind these technologies in a big way. Government incentives have turned China into the biggest market for electric vehicles. And an Indian government minister says his country wants all cars sold there by 2030 to be electric. France says it wants to end sales of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2040, while Norway’s goal is 2025.Government support could prove as crucial to the future of the technology as technical advances. If countries, states and localities encourage the spread of public charging stations, through tax breaks, other incentives or public spending, more people will take the plunge and convert. If the United States and other governments continue to spend money on research to help drive down battery costs, their economies and consumers will benefit.Some parts of the fossil fuel industry will no doubt try to sabotage the electric car revolution. In the United States, the industry is lobbying states to eliminate subsidies for the vehicles. And many analysts expect the industry to seek similar changes at the federal level from President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, who have already made clear that they do not see climate change as a major threat. They should know, though, that the most they can do is slow down the process. The electric car has already left the garage.""Electric cars are greener than gas, literally everywhereThere is, however, a caveat.I was going to write a post this morning about a study produced by advocacy group Transport & Environment that says electric cars produce fewer emissions everywhere in the European Union, even coal-dependent Poland. I mean, check out these eye-popping numbers:Then I came across a just released study by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle from the University of Michigan that furthers this argument. Snappily titled Fuel Sources for Electricity in the Individual Countries of the World and the Consequent Emissions from Driving Electric Vehicles, the study finds that electric cars produce fewer emissions than their gas powered equivalent in every country in the world, even Botswana and Gibraltar, which produce 100% of their electricity from coal and oil respectively. But just how green they are varies a staggering amount. Here's how Forbes reported on this study:...since Albania generates 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric power, any EV on the roads there is a 5,100-MPG champ. On the other end of the spectrum lies a country like Botswana. Since it gets all of its electricity from coal and oil, any electric vehicle there is like a 29-MPG car, a bit better than the average new vehicle in the U.S. Speaking of the United States, the average EV here gets 55.4 MPGghg.That said, a couple of things should be noted about this study: It doesn't take into account emissions created during manufacturing (which are higher for electric vehicles), and it appears to be looking at average vehicle emissions—meaning small, low range EVs are being pitted against big, fat SUVs.Which brings me to a rather over dramatized headline in the Financial Times: Electric cars' green image blackens underneath the hood. Here, the FT cites an MIT study that finds large electric cars—like the Tesla Model S 100D— can produce 61,115 kg of CO2 equivalent over the course of 270,000km of driving once manufacturing emissions are taken into account. This is compared to 51,891 for a small, gas-powered car like the Mitsubishi Mirage. That's assuming, however, that the car is driven in the relatively coal-dependent US Midwest, and that the cars' lifespans are the same (a questionable assertion given the relative mechanical simplicity of an electric vehicle).The message here, as the Financial Times itself points out, is not that electric cars are dirtier than gas cars. After all, a BMW 7 series produced nearly twice the emissions of the Tesla in the same study—and electric cars are always greener than equivalent sized non-electric cars. It's that putting an electric drivetrain in an oversized car and giving it more range than it needs is not the greenest way to fix our transportation problems. Instead, we need a multi-pronged approach that goes something like this:1) Switch all vehicles to electric drivetrains.2) Clean up the electrical grid so they run on renewables.3) Encourage the use of smaller vehicles with only as much range as is realistically needed.4) Promote ridesharing and alternatives to car ownership, so manufacturing emissions are spread over a greater number of passenger miles.5) Rethink planning and transportation so that cars aren't necessary.[Note: This list was updated to include the importance of cleaning up the grid.]I write a lot about electric cars. I drive two plug-in vehicles. They offer a significant improvement over their gas- and diesel-powered equivalents. But they are by no means a panacea.We can do better.""Converting seawater to fuel, storing energy in salt, and using robotics to drill geothermal wells. These are all ideas that have gone through Alphabet's “moonshot factory"" named X, formerly Google X, which builds and tests out prototypes in an attempt to address really big global problems like climate change.At the New York Times' ClimateTECH conference on Thursday in downtown San Francisco, the head of X, Astro Teller, detailed some of the internet giant’s most successful, and most unsuccessful, projects that relate to energy and reducing carbon emissions.Some X projects were created specifically to fight climate change, like the seawater idea. Others, Teller said, will likely have the indirect effect of reducing emissions, like Google’s self-driving car efforts, which were once part of X, but are now a separate division at Alphabet.Teller -- dubbed the captain of moonshots -- is as gleeful about his team's failures as he is about the successes. For example, he related that he was quite pleased when he and a colleague quickly rejected an idea to harness energy from avalanches. Working through some of the crazier ideas and swiftly proving why they won’t work is a key part of the process at the Google lab, as Teller describes it.He highlighted the seawater project, called Foghorn, which Google killed off two years after it was born because the group didn’t see how it could deliver alternative fuel economically. “It’s one of the ones we’re most proud of that didn’t work,” he said.Foghorn, working with scientists at PARC, built technology that collected hydrogen and carbon dioxide from seawater and combined those ingredients to make a fuel used in engines. The program was led by Kathy Cooper, the colleague with whom Teller hashed out the avalanche energy brain teaser.A New No. 2 State for Utility PV: The Upside of Solar in Florida“We were making vials of methane. We were unbelievably excited about this,” said Teller.Alas, as many entrepreneurs and investors have learned from the biofuels markets, at the end of the day it’s all about the cost of making a gallon of fuel. While the Foghorn team originally thought they could make the seawater fuel for $5 to $6 per gallon of gasoline equivalent, after two years the technology appeared to be closer to $15 per gallon. At the same time, the price of gasoline had dropped closer to $3 per gallon.Cooper spearheaded winding down the project and published details about the technology in an effort to see if anyone outside of Google could continue the work. After the project closed, Cooper got a promotion and later went on to lead another X project, Teller said. X has created a culture that enables researchers to take risks, fail and move on to new ideas.The salt battery is an example of an X project that the lab took halfway to the finish line, but now needs partners to complete, said Teller. The technology, called Malta, is based upon the work of Stanford physics professor Robert Laughlin, who created a model for storing thermal energy in molten salt with high efficiency.“It’s like pumped hydro in a box,” Teller said. Malta is now looking for partners to help it build a “megawatt-scale” prototype plant large enough to test the technology at a commercial scale.However, it’s unclear what institution would be willing to put up the funds for such an unproven concept, particularly since the cost of lithium-ion batteries has dropped dramatically.Another X project has focused on using robotics to build geothermal pipes to heat and cool homes. This year the project was spun out into a separate company called Dandelion.Teller described the technology behind Dandelion as speeding up the process of drilling a geothermal system from several weeks to several hours. “This is a real business, but not one that X should be in,” said Teller, explaining the spinoff. Cooper, the former head of Foghorn, is now heading up that company.Teller briefly touched on X’s high-altitude wind project, which it acquired several years ago through the startup Makani Power. While Makani’s tech has appeared to struggle to be commercialized, Makani’s head Fort Felker told Greentech Media earlier this year that the company still remains committed to the technology.It’s easy to dismiss Google’s moonshot climate-change work as irrational, uneconomic and uninformed. And it can be all of those things.But that’s not the point. It's an R&D lab developed by a wealthy company that can afford it and that inspires its workers and partners.  Google has no doubt had a much bigger effect on fighting climate change by spearheading corporate efforts to embrace clean energy. The company has spent over $2 billion on using clean energy for its energy-hungry data centers. At the same time, Google has often acted as a customer for young energy-tech startups, like Bloom Energy (when it was first founded).But the X lab is an effort to create something else entirely: an environment that can birth new ideas and keep its talent engaged. It’s understandable that many of them would naturally gravitate to trying to tackle climate change. Teller compared Google’s moonshot lab to the work being done by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a billion-dollar venture led by Bill Gates, John Doerr, Vinod Khosla and others to invest in energy research and development.With dwindling federal government support, efforts to invest in innovative climate tech are becoming increasingly rare. “Two is not enough,"" said Teller, referring to Breakthrough and Google X. ""We need another ten.""""Companies are realizing that renewable energy is good for businessWhen will individuals follow suit?The conservative city of Georgetown, Texas, runs on renewable energy. After all, wind and solar power are more predictable and easier to budget than oil and gas. Clean power pushes may be associated with more left-leaning cities, but Republican mayor Dale Ross called the switch to renewables a no-brainer.On November 14, Joe Brown, editor in chief of Popular Science, and Ali Velshi, anchor at MSNBC, teamed up to discuss why going green is often more than the best ecological decision. It's often the best business decision, too.The pair discussed natural disasters, which cost taxpayers billions of dollars. In 2017, at least 15 weather events cost the government more than a billion dollars each. “The most expensive events we have in the U.S. are floods,” says Velshi. The money spent preparing for and preventing these events—by raising houses and bolting bookshelves—pays itself back double, triple, and even quadruple times over. And as scientists continue to find evidence that climate change makes these storms worse, it's increasingly clear that the mitigation of global warming should be at the top of our list of preventative measures.But companies and private citizens often fail to prepare properly because the money spent on prevention is private, whereas costs after the fact are often allotted through government organizations like FEMA. Many fail to connect the cost of switching to renewable energy with the eventual savings of avoiding natural disasters. “I think anyone who knows anything about science understands this is a problem,” says Velshi. “But if you don’t live near the coast, it may not register.”On an even larger scale, the costs of switching to renewable energy are larger up front, though they save money in the future. For example, Denmark struggled to store its wind power in a way that allowed them to save it for times of high electricity demand. Then they encouraged residents to buy electric cars. Now these vehicles act like moving batteries, and people can sell the energy back to the grid when the cars are parked. “They are giving people monetary incentives,” says Brown.Companies that do right by the climate don’t just make more money over time. They earn customer trust. Brown polled the audience to see who bought Patagonia mountain gear because the company famously practices environmental conscientiousness. Many bought Patagonia clothing for this reason. Ford and Heineken are companies that most people don’t necessarily associate with green practices, but that might soon change. After the last fuel crisis in 2010, Ford created F150s that are lighter and more energy-efficient. The company also hired the architect Bill McDonough to redesign the Ford Rouge Center, a manufacturing facility built on the wetlands of Michigan. Ford wanted to clean up toxic stormwater and expand the plant. Now, the roof is covered with plants that clean rainwater and moderate the temperature of the building.“It’s not cheaper, but once you get everybody bought in that this is your legacy, these are your children, this is your brand, I’ll think that will be a turning point,” says Velshi.Still, state and local governments, such as mayor Dale Ross’s municipal government in Georgetown, Texas, have the most power to make long-lasting changes in green energy. They have the power to approve new building projects and hand out permits. Velshi calls for more conversation with civic leaders, in addition to individual conscientiousness. “Go vote,” says Velshi. “We all need to show up.”""ELON MUSK RENEWABLE ENERGY: LARGEST EVER LITHIUM-ION BATTERY SWITCHED ON IN AUSTRALIAElon Musk’s giant lithium-ion battery is now live in Australia. Completed weeks ahead of schedule, Tesla has won a massive money-back bet with the Australian government. The 129-megawatt-hour battery—the largest in the world—will store and dispatch energy generated by a nearby wind farm. This should provide a reliable electricity supply for 3,000 homes, according to the Wall Street Journal.Elon Musk tweeted that he would complete the giant battery within 100 days of signing the contract, repeating the claims made by Tesla vice-president, Lyndon Rive, at the launch of the Powerwall 2 battery. If the company failed, Musk promised to give Australia the battery for free. Part of a $390 million government energy plan, this could have proved an expensive gamble for the entrepreneur, Reuters reports.Today’s big switch-on marks only 63 days since the September 29 signing, slashing the 100-day window by over one third. The mammoth powerbank was completed just last week.“South Australia is now leading the world in dispatchable renewable energy, delivered to homes and businesses 24/7,” South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said in a press release. “This is history in the making.”Frequent blackouts have been causing havoc in South Australia. In fact, much of country is facing an energy crisis, according to the Australian Financial Review. A 1,600 megawatt coal plant closure in Victoria earlier this year added to mounting pressures on the country’s gas industry, which faced huge lay-offs, rising prices and gas shortages.In March of this year, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnball declared an emergency in the face of escalating troubles surrounding the country’s energy supply.Battery storage systems like Musk’s are hoped to steady this turbulence as a key element of the Australian government’s Energy Plan, announced in light of the crisis. ""The South Australian Government should be congratulated for ensuring their energy supply is not only sustainable, but will help solve power shortages, reduce variability, and manage summertime peak load,"" Tesla said in a statement. Looking to the future, Rive has claimed the South Australia project could be repeated elsewhere across the country. Not content with firing up the largest battery in the world, Musk is running other renewable energy projects around the world. After a battering from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s energy supply was in a state of crisis. Tesla powered up a children’s hospital in Guaynbo using solar panels and batteries, Vox reports.""Regulators in South Korea summoned Google (GOOGL, Tech30) representatives this week to question them about a report that claimed the company was collecting data from Android devices even when location services were disabled.The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) ""is carrying out an inquiry into the claims that Google collected users' Cell ID data without consent even when their smartphone's location service was inactive,"" Chun Ji-hyun, head of KCC's privacy infringement division, told CNNMoney on Friday.U.K. data protection officials are also looking into the matter.""Organizations are required by law to be transparent with consumers about what they are doing with personal information,"" said a spokesperson for the Information Commissioner's Office.

Among those, the hackers stole 600,000 driver's license numbers of drivers for the company.Related: Uber paid hackers $100,000 after they stole data on 57 million usersKhosrowshahi says hackers accessed the data through a third-party, cloud-based service. According to Bloomberg, they got into Uber's GitHub account, a site many engineers and companies use to store code and track projects. There, hackers found the username and password to access Uber user data stored in an Amazon server.Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at security firm SentinelOne, says this was not a sophisticated hack. Companies frequently accidentally keep credentials in source code that is uploaded to GitHub, he said.The $100,000 paymentInstead of alerting users and authorities to the breach as required by law, Uber paid the hackers $100,000.Uber says it obtained assurances the data was destroyed.Law enforcement advises companies to not pay hackers and report breaches to the authorities.According to Andrea Matwyshyn, professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University, if companies help cyber criminals make money off hacks, they will only continue.""The problem with viewing this as some sort of simple risk management decision is that it underestimates the basis for an attacker's business model,"" Matwyshyn told CNN Tech. ""It doesn't address the underlying problem in your own organization -- your security practices need revision and you're failing to adequately protect your assets including your own proprietary information, and your customers' data.""Paying hackers to return data is common practice. For instance, it's expected ransomware payments -- paying hackers to unlock files after a cyberattack -- will top $2 billion this year, according to new research from cybersecurity firm Bitdefender.Uber's payoff to prevent hackers from leaking the stolen data is more similar to recent extortion attempts on Netflix and HBO than ransomware campaigns. Hackers threatened to release TV shows unless the companies paid them. Neither firm paid the extortionists.New legal troublesMatwyshyn says it's possible Uber will face consequences from both state and federal agencies.Forty-eight states have security breach notification laws which require companies to disclose when hackers access private information, including California, where Uber is headquartered.State Attorneys General from New York and Massachusetts have opened investigations into the data breach.In Washington, D.C., Senator Richard Blumenthal urged the Federal Trade Commission to take action against the company and impose ""significant penalties.""""Senate Commerce Committee should hold hearing to demand Uber explain their outrageous breach - and inexplicable delay in informing its consumers and drivers,"" Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a tweet on Wednesday.An FTC spokesman said in a statement: ""We are aware of press reports describing a breach in late 2016 at Uber and Uber officials' actions after that breach. We are closely evaluating the serious issues raised.""In January, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle FTC charges it misled drivers about how much they could make using the platform.The company also settled FTC allegations that it made deceptive privacy and security claims in August. A hacker accessed Uber data on more than 100,000 drivers in May 2014. Further, the FTC said Uber did not properly monitor employee access to customer information.The agency gave Uber 180 days to obtain an independent audit into its privacy and security practices. Tuesday's data breach notification falls within that time frame.International attentionOther countries have similar rules regarding breaches. The U.K.'s top data privacy organization slammed Uber on Wednesday.""If U.K. citizens were affected then we should have been notified so that we could assess and verify the impact on people whose data was exposed,"" James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of the Information Commissioner's Office, said in a statement. ""Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies.""The Office of the Australian Information and Privacy Commissioner said it was aware of the hack, and had ""commenced inquiries with Uber.""The Italian Data Protection Authority said it assessing the scale of the breach. ""We are dismayed by the poor transparency shown towards users, which we intend to investigate,"" authority president Antonello Soro said in a statement.In the Philippines, the National Privacy Commission summoned local Uber officials to a meeting on Thursday.Yet another data breachIn terms of scale, Uber's hack doesn't measure up to other major breaches. Cyber criminals targeted Equifax earlier this year, compromising the personal information -- including names, addresses and social security numbers -- of over 145 million people. In 2013, a hack of Yahoo impacted very single account -- 3 billion in total.Former executives from both of these companies have testified in front of Congress in recent months regarding their security failures and the potential risks to consumers.But Uber's breach is different -- the company tried to cover it up and did not alert authorities or users of the issue.Consumers might find this latest Uber scandal more troubling than its other legal or public relations problems now that they're the victims. Fifty-seven million people is a significant chunk of Uber's user base, which hit 40 million monthly active riders last year.Grossman says the breach may not change consumer behavior, but it will be costly for the company.""At best, it will impact their bottom line. The cost of dealing with this -- they're going to have lawsuits and legal fees,"" Grossman said.He also said the disclosure helps get it out in the open so the company can begin moving toward repairing its reputation.Uber's future plansWhen Khosrowshahi became CEO in August, he inherited a slew of controversial problems. In addition to its legal troubles, Uber has faced criticism for sexual harassment issues, underpaying and deceiving drivers, questioning a rape victim, and surge pricing during times of crisis.The new CEO wants to improve Uber's reputation and on Tuesday said, ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.""Khosrowshahi said the company fired two individuals who led security response. Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, is no longer with the company, it said.CEO Travis Kalanick, who was in charge when the hack took place, is still on the company's board of directors. While Khosrowshahi is promising change, Kalanick's place in a leadership role serves as a reminder they are keeping someone who signed off on controversial issues tied to the company.Uber is expected to go public in 2019.""Skype yanked from app stores in ChinaXi Jinping's rise to powerChina is cracking down on Skype.Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has yanked the online video calling app and other voice over internet protocol (VoIP) products from its App Store in China.""We have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of VoIP apps do not comply with local law, therefore these apps have been removed from the App Store in China,"" Apple said in a statement on Wednesday. ""These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.""The video chat and messaging app is also unavailable on major third-party Android app stores, like the ones run by Chinese smartphone makers Huawei and Xiaomi. The New York Times was the first to report the news.china censorshipSkype, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), is one of the few Western-operated internet communication services operating in China. For now, Skype video chats and phone calls still work in China, but users began complaining on social media about being unable to upgrade the app or buy credit to make Skype calls more than a month ago.Microsoft confirmed that Skype had been ""temporarily removed"" from the app store in China.""We are working to reinstate the app as soon as possible,"" Microsoft said in a statement.Many popular foreign tech and internet companies are locked out of China by the so-called Great Firewall, the country's huge apparatus of internet filters used to censor content it deems harmful. Google (GOOG), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) have been blocked in China for years, as have several foreign news outlets.Skype and similar products from app stores have encryption features that make messages more difficult for China's regulators to track. Beijing also requires accounts to be affiliated with real name identifications, which is not something Skype demands of users.China's internet regulators did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The clampdown is part of a wider trend of tightening controls and restrictions under President Xi Jinping.In recent months, authorities have cracked down on everything from Facebook's popular messaging app WhatsApp to pictures of Winnie the Pooh.App store operators like Apple have also felt the squeeze. In July, Apple removed software from its app store that allows users to bypass the Great Firewall. Last December, authorities had Apple (AAPL, Tech30) pull New York Times news apps from the App Store in China, after blocking the U.S. publication's English and Chinese websites for the better part of five years.Apple has come under fire for repeatedly complying with authorities' requests, with critics accusing the company of aiding China's censorship efforts.""Review: Google Pixel Buds falls short of promiseA trilingual chat with Google Pixel Buds goes awryThe launch of another pair of wireless headphones isn't that exciting.But when Google (GOOG) announced its new Pixel Buds in October, touting the ability to translate a conversation between different languages in near real time, it promised something unique.With over 7,000 languages spoken around the world, the ease of wiping away language barriers with technology has obvious allure. Travelers could visit any country and instantly talk to locals. It could help displaced populations connect with new communities. Jobs would become accessible to more people worldwide.But the Pixel Buds don't fulfill that promise, at least not yet.The $159 Bluetooth earbuds work with recent Android and iOS devices, but the translation feature is specific to Google Pixel smartphones.Without a Pixel phone, you're getting somewhat uncomfortable wireless headphones with decent sound quality and a hefty price tag.google pixel budsTo use the instant translate feature, put on the headphones, press and hold the right bud, and say, ""Help me speak Italian."" It fires up the Google Translate app, and you hand your smartphone to the other person.While wearing the earbuds, you can say a phrase, such as ""I love your hat. Where did you get it?"" The Pixel phone will then translate the phrase out loud in Italian using its built-in Google Assistant.The other person can press the microphone button on the Pixel phone to speak a response in Italian. You'll hear the English translation via the ear buds.Related: Google's Pixelbook is a pretty ad for ChromebooksSince it launched over 11 years ago, the free Google Translate site and app has grown to include more than 100 languages. But only 40 are currently supported by Pixel Buds.The usual caveats of using a machine translation tool to communicate with someone still apply. The results are typically close enough to make a conversation possible, if you speak in clear sentences, don't ramble, and avoid idioms. (That's probably good advice for all conversations.)Translations happen fast, but background noise was a problem. The Pixel Buds sometimes prematurely thought I was done talking.The app shows the written translation on the phone screen -- a helpful feature. But overall, the technology is not yet fluid enough to have long, deep conversations about politics, business or the meaning of life. You will definitely be able to find the nearest restroom.The two black earbuds are connected to each other by a cord. I prefer the cord to Apple's free-floating EarPods, but some people may find it to be too bulky.The adjustable loop of cord kept the Pixel Buds in place, but the plastic buds themselves didn't fit comfortably into my ears. Because ears are not all the same shape, an earbud that's uncomfortable for one person may fit perfectly for another.Google's earbuds come in an attractive fabric case that doubles as a charging dock. The earpieces don't click into place as easily as they should, and you have to wind the cable around them each time, leaving a loop hanging out. Apple's EarPods win on compact packaging and charging.For Pixel phone owners interested in translation, the Pixel Buds are unquestionably a fun option, but they're not ready for professional level tasks. If you only want them to listen to music and podcasts, there are cheaper options available with similar or better sound quality.In the end, it's not worth buying a Pixel phone specifically to get the Pixel Buds. After all, anyone can download the free Google Translate app on Android or iOS and get a similar experience.""Alibaba gobbles up stake in China's WalmartYou need an app to shop in Alibaba's grocery storesAlibaba's appetite for grocery stores shows no signs of letting up.The Chinese e-commerce giant said it would pay $2.9 billion for a 36% stake in Sun Art Retail Group (SURRY), widely considered China's answer to Walmart (WMT).Sun Art Retail runs nearly 450 hypermarkets across China under its Auchan and RT-Mart brands.Related: Alibaba is investing $15 billion in global techThe investment is being made via Alibaba (BABA, Tech30)'s popular online shopping platform Taobao.Alibaba has been bolstering its presence in traditional retail over the past couple of years. Its Hema groceries brand combines elements of online and offline shopping.Market Sectors: See latest news & which stock market segments are performing bestThe strategy is part of the company's efforts to capture a big slice of China's online food market, which is expected to be worth $180 billion by 2020, according to research firm IGD. China's overall grocery market is currently worth more than $1.2 trillion, second only to the United States, IGD said.Earlier this year, Alibaba spent $2.6 billion to snap up Intime Retail, which operates 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls in China. The firm also owns a 20% stake in electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group, for which it paid $4.6 billion in 2015.Related: $24 billion in 24 hours: World's biggest shopping day sets a new recordAlibaba's latest move comes a few months after American rival Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) paid $13.7 billion to swallow grocery chain Whole Foods.Shares in Sun Art Retail plunged as much as 13.6% in Hong Kong trading Monday morning following news of the Alibaba deal.That's because the price Alibaba is paying works out at just 6.5 Hong Kong dollars ($0.83) per share, far lower than the stock's Friday closing price of 8.6 Hong Kong dollars.""Pentagon exposed some of its data on Amazon serverA researcher says the Pentagon exposed huge amounts of web-monitoring data in a security failure.Anyone with a free Amazon Web Services account could have looked at the hoard of information stored in the cloud by the U.S. Defense Department, according to Chris Vickery, a researcher at cybersecurity firm UpGuard who discovered the exposure.Amazon Web Services is a cloud platform that individuals, businesses and the government use for things like storing data and boosting computing power. Amazon said on its website it is best practice to restrict access to information stored in the cloud to ""people that absolutely need it.""The military databases hold at least 1.8 billion internet posts scraped from social media, news sites, forums and other publicly available websites, Vickery told CNN Tech. The posts are in multiple languages and originate from countries across the world, including the United States.The information, which Vickery said goes back as far back as 2009, is held by U.S. Central Command (Centcom) and U.S. Pacific Command (Pacom). There's no indication that malicious attackers accessed the databases. The Defense Department secured the data by October 1 after Vickery alerted officials of the problem in mid-September, he said.The information that was exposed had been publicly available -- it was not, for instance, sensitive user data. Still, the failure to fully secure the data raises concerns about government cybersecurity practices.""[It's] a pretty serious leak when you're talking about intelligence information being stored in an Amazon cloud service and not properly safeguarded,"" said Timothy Edgar, a former White House official in the Obama administration and former U.S. intelligence official.Edgar said he frequently questioned the security and implementation of cloud technology while working in intelligence. ""That's exactly what we were worried about,"" he said.Cloud computing allows a large organization like a government agency or business to readily access information stored on remote servers from far-flung locations. It is increasingly how data is stored.The Defense Department confirmed the exposure in an email to CNN Tech.""We determined that the data was accessed via unauthorized means by employing methods to circumvent security protocols,"" said Maj. Josh Jacques, a spokesperson for U.S. Central Command. ""Once alerted to the unauthorized access, Centcom implemented additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access.""How the data was discoveredAmazon (AMZN, Tech30) servers where data is stored, called S3 buckets, are private by default. Private means only authorized users can access them. For one to be made more widely accessible, someone would have to configure it to be available to all Amazon Web Services users, but users would need to know or find the name of the bucket in order to access it.By searching specific keywords, Vickery identifies information that companies and organizations inadvertently expose. In this case, he looked for buckets containing the word ""com.""Three S3 buckets were configured to allow anyone with an Amazon Web Services account to access them. They were labeled ""centcom-backup,"" ""centcom-archive"" and ""pacom-archive,"" Vickery said.Last week, Amazon introduced new S3 security features, including displaying an indicator next to any bucket that is publicly accessible.Related: Data of almost 200 million voters leaked onlineThis is not the first exposure of data Vickery has discovered. He previously found major leaks from Verizon and a Republican analytics firm. Both firms closed the security holes once alerted to the issue.""The overall goal is to make people aware that data breaches and companies exposing data haphazardly is a huge, epidemic-sized problem,"" Vickery said. ""If something of this size and importance suffers from the same problem, we need to start taking it a lot more seriously.""This isn't the first time Centcom experienced an online security failure. In 2015, hackers took over the agency's Twitter account.What's insideThe data that was exposed includes information from Twitter, Facebook and other public websites.The posts originate from many countries and are written in different languages, with an emphasis on Arabic, Farsi, and other Central and South Asian dialects spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Vickery. Although the content goes back eight years, the uploads appear to have begun in 2013 and were ongoing when Vickery found the data.Vickery analyzed a small fraction of it. Posts included comments from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook; local U.S. websites that focus on sports and guns; scam alert websites; and forums containing offensive content.UpGuard, Vickery's firm, shared some English-language posts with CNN Tech.Topics included: American history, President Trump, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, ""killer clowns,"" Russia, former President Obama, Russian president Vladimir Putin, American pop stars, and the Pope.Inside one Centcom data bucket is a folder labeled Outpost. Vickery's analysis indicates the folder contains information from a third-party contractor called Vendor X. This company no longer has an active presence online.According to the LinkedIn profile of Erik Kjell Berg, former vice president of product at Vendor X, Outpost is ""a multilingual social analytics platform designed to positively influence change in high-risk youth in unstable regions of the world, built exclusively for the Dept. of Defense.""Berg and other former executives for Vendor X did not respond to requests for comment.Jacques, the spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, said Centcom has used commercial off-the-shelf and web-based programs for information gathering. ""The information we gather is widely available to anyone who conducts similar online activities,"" he said.What the data is used forThe purpose of the data collection effort is not clear.Jacques said it is ""used for measurement and engagement activities of our online programs on public sites."" He declined to elaborate, although he said it ""is not collected nor processed for any intelligence purposes.""Edgar worked in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush and later advised President Obama on privacy and cybersecurity issues.He said the rules around open-source information gathering by government agencies remain at least partly unclear.""There have been continuing question marks about the role of collecting publicly available information from social media,"" he said. ""Government intelligence officers say we shouldn't inhibit ourselves when we're talking about collecting information about potential terrorists. If the rules allow it, we should do it. But that kind of approach can get problematic because it doesn't offer a whole lot of guidance.""Another expert, Andrea Little Limbago, chief social scientist at cybersecurity firm Endgame, said it's not uncommon for the Pentagon to collect vast sums of internet data.""At times, you do need to cast a wide net, and then do the analytics to narrow down what you're trying to find,"" said Limbago, a former analyst with the Defense Department between 2007 and 2011.She said she would be surprised if the Defense Department was targeting U.S. individuals without the proper authorization.""In Berkeley's 'Cyberwar' class, students become hackersA new class at the University of California, Berkeley, is training students to hack.The class, called Cyberwar, teaches its 80 students how to find security flaws in the apps and websites people use every day.""I mostly focused on government websites, specifically voter registration websites,"" said Vy-An Phan, a junior studying electrical engineering and computer science who's enrolled in the class.During class assignments, she discovered vulnerabilities in at least five sites that could potentially be used to trick someone into registering incorrectly.""What I found was state websites and local websites were usually extremely poorly run,"" she told CNN Tech. ""If I can find [bugs], certainly someone else can.""Twice a week, students pour into Berkeley's Hewlett Packard auditorium to learn how nation-state actors and cybercriminals hack into computer systems. By learning their methods, they can learn to try and stop them.In addition to government sites, students have also uncovered vulnerabilities in various apps, including from one a bank and shopping sites. One student made $100 after reporting a bug to the company.Related: Malware researcher helps teen hackers turn skills into careersDoug Tygar, the computer science professor who teaches the class, calls it an experiment.""The goal is to train students to build super secure systems,"" Tygar told CNN Tech after a class. ""But in order to do that, they have to be able to think like a hacker.""The class works with HackerOne, a hacker-for-hire platform. Every bug a student finds is reported to the company or organization where it was found. Companies on the HackerOne platform pay hackers who find bugs in their systems. Most students target the companies that use the platform.Students also hear lectures and attend events hosted in partnership with HackerOne to learn from professional hackers.Related: Hackers will work with government, academia to make future elections secure""Unless you have the skill of being able to think like a hacker, you're not going to be able to build secure systems,"" Tygar said.The Cyberwar class won't be offered next semester, but Tygar plans to teach it again in the future. And he intends to change the name.Meanwhile, Ted Kramer, chief of staff at HackerOne, said the company wants to bring the program to more campuses.The class could help prepare students for future employment. According to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures, there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide by 2021.Phan ultimately wants a job in security testing to help companies keep apps, websites and infrastructure secure.""I find it much more rewarding than being a developer,"" she said.""Facebook wants to be seen as a force for goodFacebook on Wednesday announced several new tools related to safety, support and donations at its second annual Social Good Forum.One new feature connects mentors and mentees together through a program created by nonprofit organizations. The pilot project will include iMentor, a high school mentoring program, and the International Rescue Committee, which focuses on crisis recovery.Facebook (FB, Tech30) said it wants to eventually expand the feature and include other areas such as addiction recovery and career advancement.""Until now, Facebook has been focused on helping you connect with people you already know. But it might be just as important to help you connect with someone outside your social circle who can provide a new source of support and inspiration,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on stage at the event.Related: Facebook continues Craigslist takeover with housing rentalsFacebook's forum, held in New York City, comes amid criticism over Russian propaganda and fake news stories spreading on its platform during the U.S. presidential election last year.Earlier this month, the social network's general counsel testified before Congress about Russian meddling on the platform. It recently announced a portal that lets users see whether they liked or followed accounts associated with Russian propaganda.At Wednesday's forum, Facebook made other announcements, including the elimination of fees for nonprofits and that 100% of donations made through the platform will go directly to groups. It also unveiled a $50 million Facebook Donations Fund to help communities with disaster recovery via direct donations and matching contributions.""When I started Facebook, I wasn't thinking about it as a way to raise money [to fight diseases],"" Zuckerberg said.But the company noticed people were raising money for a variety of causes on the platform, he added.The site's giving tools, such as personal fundraisers and nonprofit donate buttons, will now also be expanded to Europe, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.Facebook is also expanding its blood donation tool to Bangladesh early next year. It first launched the feature in India, which is another country in greater need of blood donors, in October.""People were already using Facebook for blood donation and fundraising. We're building tools to make it even easier,"" Naomi Gleit, Facebook VP of Social Good, told CNN Tech.Related: Facebook is rolling out AI-based suicide prevention effortEarlier this week, the company announced it would expand its automated effort to help prevent suicide.These tools come after Facebook changed its mission this summer from connecting people to ""[giving] the people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.""Being seen as an altruistic company has its advantages, especially with younger people who are more likely to associate with companies who share their values, according to Chris McClean, vice president at research firm Forrester.""Companies that are showing they're strong on values and authentic ... are gaining trust and loyalty of consumers. This eventually, of course, translates to revenue, but they have to be authentic with those values first,"" he said.However, Facebook's biggest potential risk is that it comes off disingenuous with these efforts.""People very quickly identify companies that make a big PR or marketing splash, but don't follow it up with investment,"" McClean said.""Amazon's wish lists are changing the way we donateHolidays are hard for the mothers incarcerated at Logan Correctional Center in Illinois.But for the fourth year in a row, hundreds of the women will be able to pick out and wrap presents to hand to their children, thanks in part to Amazon wish lists.""[Gift giving] is a simple thing that every parent wants to be able to do for their child, but it's something incredibly difficult for mothers who are incarcerated to do,"" said Holly Krig, the director of organizing for Moms United Against Violence & Incarceration.Moms United runs an annual gift drive for mothers in seven local correctional institutions, including Logan. Instead of the typical toy drive, anyone who wants to help can send gifts directly to the prisons from an Amazon wish list.The Amazon tool allows users to create a list of items they want most, and others can access it for gift-giving ideas or to make a purchase. They were originally designed for baby and wedding registries or individual birthday requests.But there has been an uptick in organizations using Amazon wish lists in the last year according to Charity Navigator, a group that rates charities.After Hurricane Harvey, multiple organizations in Texas used the tool to get goods on the ground. There's a list to buy hand warmers and socks for the homeless. Another to send books and movies to unaccompanied immigrant children who are detained in Virginia and Maryland. The ASPCA has multiple lists, including one for animals affected by recent natural disasters and another just for foster kittens.Moms united chicagoCharities are setting up Amazon wish lists to get donations sent exactly where they need them.""People tend to prefer giving something concrete, and it's easier to visualize or imagine what the impact is when it's something specific,"" said Krig. ""People enjoy picking toys and imagining kids receiving things""By engaging people where they're already doing the bulk of their online shopping, the lists eliminate major barriers to donating. Amazon Prime has an estimated 90 million members in the U.S. These users are potential donors who won't need to enter payment information, slog through an unfamiliar interface, or pay for most shipping. Using Amazon's lists for donations is a bit of a hack.Amazon doesn't have settings or options specifically for non-profits or large groups, such as verification. The company didn't reply to a request for comment.Managing a list takes a lot of work, according to Krig, and she has deep concerns about the company's labor practices. But Amazon's large inventory makes it easy to find gifts that meet the prisons' security standards. The prisons also specifically request donations be shipped directly from Amazon, which is considered a trusted source.Charitable giving experts usually recommend giving cash instead of goods. However, wish lists can ensure a charity only gets what it requires.""Unlike the well-intentioned, but misguided, collections that can happen after a natural disaster ... wish lists are created by the nonprofit, so donors know they are fulfilling a nonprofit need,"" said Katherina Rosqueta, executive director of The Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the University of Pennsylvania.Potter Park Zoo AmazonThe Potter Park Zoo in Lansing, Michigan, knew that Ulana the African lion needed a giant blue ball. The toy was donated through the Amazon wish list the zoo has managed for five years. The list specifies what animal gets an item, so you know fake grass rugs go to penguins, and that a mongoose will enjoy the plastic easter eggs.Even when using a wish list is an option, giving money can still be a more effective way of helping those in need. Cash donations are easier to manage and give organizations more flexibility.""Wish lists are probably not the most efficient way to help nonprofits and their beneficiaries. Many nonprofits have partnerships that allow them to buy items they need in bulk at a better rate than donors might get on Amazon,"" said Rosqueta.For Moms United Against Violence and Incarceration, the annual drive is as much about connecting moms and kids as it is raising awareness.""It's an opportunity to talk about the underlying issues and why we have to have these campaigns at all,"" said Krig.""A school. Lord & Taylor's flagship Fifth Avenue avenue store. Now, Meetup.com.WeWork, the real estate company best known for its shared co-working locations, has been on a noticeable buying binge.It announced its latest acquisition on Tuesday: Meetup.com, a hobby community platform that aims to bring people together for shared experiences -- from book clubs to motorcycle enthusiast groups. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.According to WeWork, 100,000 people have attended Meetups in WeWork locations this year.

It's raised more than $9 billion to date, including $4.4 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank earlier this year.Ahead of the acquisition spree, it brought on Emily Keeton, who helped oversee mergers and acquisitions at IAC, in May.A month later, WeWork acquired FieldLens, a construction management platform. In August, it took ownership of Israeli enterprise sales tool Unomy and Spacemob, a Southeast Asian competitor to WeWork.Other expenditures, however, have been a bit more unexpected.Related: WeWork snaps up coding bootcamp Flatiron SchoolIn October, it bought Lord & Taylor's iconic department store on Fifth Avenue for $850 million to serve as its new headquarters.

It's also experimenting with shared housing and recently opened fitness facility Rise by We in New York City.While the acquisitions appear to be all over the map, Kathleen Smith -- principal at Renaissance Capital -- said the buying spree isn't an ""uncommon"" strategy for a company looking to bolster revenue and quickly scale.""It's trying to acquire operations that will enhance their infrastructure and get more use out of it,"" Smith told CNN Tech. ""I think this is an effort to build a more substantial company [that can] get it to the point of going public.""Earlier this year, WeWork CEO and cofounder Adam Neumann said the company is generating $1 billion a year in revenue.

It will also use the technology to prioritize the order its team reviews posts.In March, Facebook (FB, Tech30) began a limited test of AI-based suicide prevention efforts on text-only posts in the U.S.Its latest effort will bring the automated flagging tools on text and video posts globally, except in the EU where data privacy restrictions are different than other parts of the world.In a blog post, the company detailed how AI looks for patterns on posts that may contain references to suicide or self-harm. In addition to searching for words and phrases in posts, it will scan the comments. According to Facebook, comments like ""Are you ok?"" and ""Can I help?"" can potentially be an indicator of suicidal thoughts.Related: Can algorithms help kick addiction?If the the team reviews a post and determines an immediate intervention is necessary, Facebook may work with first responders to send help. The social network may also reach out to users via Facebook Messenger with resources, such as links to the Crisis Text Line, National Eating Disorder Association, and National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.Facebook will use AI to make sure its team reviews posts of those most in distress first.The move is a part of an effort to further support its at-risk users. Facebook has faced criticism for its Facebook Live feature, where some users have live streamed graphic events, including suicide.Related: Meet the 78-year-old Crisis Text Line counselorThe automated effort's test which began earlier this year appears to a success so far, according to Guy Rosen, vice president of product management.""Over the last month, we've worked with first responders on over 100 wellness checks based on reports we received via our proactive detection efforts,"" said Rosen.That number does not include reports from people in the Facebook community.

They sold it on street corners in Santa Monica.Flux became a hit, so they started accepting online orders. They packaged and shipped them out to customers from a fraternity house.""It wasn't the greatest condition for running a business, especially in terms of just cleanliness, so that's when we decided to outsource distribution,"" said Flux co-founder Miles Anthony.Now, Flux chargers are sold between $30 and $50 at B8ta, a retail store with eight locations in the U.S.The tech gadget store is betting on a new kind of business model. Instead of taking a percentage of any profits, it charges hardware makers a flat fee to display their product. For example, Flux pays $2,000 a month for placement in multiple stores.In exchange, B8ta collects data on show shoppers interact with products.Its San Francisco store has 24 stereoscopic cameras monitoring visitors sales and browsing habits. The cameras are clearly visible throughout the store, and the data collected is anonymous, the company said.Although some retailers already track shopper behavior, B8ta has folded it into how it does business. The gadget makers get updates with how many impressions, discoveries, demos and sales their products have received.Related: Amazon wants you to shop for Black Friday in augmented reality B8ta storeAnother goal of the store is to educate shoppers about products. In fact, b8Ta doesn't even care if you buy the items somewhere else.""if you want to buy this on Amazon, that's OK,"" said B8ta's co-founder Phillip Raub. ""We're not threatened by that at all.""Inside, the space looks like an Apple Store's moodier cousin. B8ta stores are open and minimalist, with lines of products available to touch and test. An iPad Mini sits next to each gadget and displays product information about it.B8ta's inventory is a mix of useful and kitschy technology, not unlike what you'd find in a Brookstone or Sharper Image. There are wi-fi speakers, security cameras, electric bikes, and connected home devices. If you're looking for something unusual try the floss dispenser that frowns when you go too long without flossing, or the Fondoodler cheese-dispensing ""hot-glue gun.""A spot in a real brick-and-mortar store wouldn't be possible for many of these companies. The majority of gadgets come from startups founded by people who whipped up a hit Kickstarter campaign.""Where else would they have the opportunity to bring their hardware into a store?"" said Vibhu Norby, another of B8ta's co-founders.Founded in 2015, the company wants to position itself as the next trend in retail, an industry currently undergoing big changes. Traditional stores are closing at an alarming rate, retail stocks are struggling and some companies are going bankrupt. B8ta sees the shifts more as an opportunity than a warning.""We're sick and tired of saying retail's dead,"" said Norby. ""It's too important of an industry to just write off and say it's dead.""Related: The future of getting dressed: AI, VR and smart fabricsMeanwhile, online sales are increasing, fueled by companies like Amazon. But retail will survive because there's no way to recreate ""the emotional experience of a demo,"" according to B8ta's founders. You can't tell how a product feels in your hand or hear the quality of a high-end speaker over the internet.""It's quite clear that a whole host of legacy players are becoming increasingly irrelevant,"" said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia's Graduate School of Business. ""There is no shortage of customers and most have plenty of disposable income and/or access to consumer credit. They will most definitely continue to shop for their needs and wants. They just aren't shopping at their ubiquitous local Macy's or JC Penney anymore.""One way those legacy retailers are trying stay relevant is by partnering with B8ta. The company has struck deals with established chains like Lowe's and Macy's to open mini-stores inside their existing locations.For Flux's Anthony, it's one less thing to worry about. He said the entire production process for his chargers is automated — he doesn't even see the product anymore. Flux chargers are manufactured in China and shipped directly to a distribution company in Austin that stores and ships the inventory.The vast majority of Flux's sales currently happen on Amazon.com, but a retail spot still has its allure.""We got into a pretty cool tech store,"" said Anthony. ""It really validated our whole business and product.""""Apple's HomePod speaker delayed until next yearWatch out, Echo: Apple announces HomePod speakerIf you were hoping to buy a HomePod for your honey this holiday season, you'll have to come up with plan b.Apple confirmed on Friday its expensive Siri-powered smart speaker has been delayed.Instead of being available in December, it will ship early next year, the company told CNN Tech.Apple HomePod will be its first big new hardware product since the Apple Watch.The tech giant announced the speaker in June at its annual developer conference. Although Siri was early to the voice assistant party, the company is late to the smart speaker trend. Amazon invented the category in 2015 with the Echo, and there are now similar options available from Google, Microsoft and Sonos.At $329, HomePod was poised to be one of the pricier smart speakers on the market, but it touts superior sound quality. Amazon's Echo line starts at $50. A Google Home Mini costs $49, but the company is also coming out with a higher-end version for $399.""We can't wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple's breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it's ready for our customers,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We'll start shipping in the US, UK and Australia in early 2018.""Related: Smart speaker 101Smart speakers use ""always listening"" microphones to detect commands, then talk back with a smart assistant, such as Siri or Alexa. They can play music, spit out trivia, manage shopping lists and put things on your calendar.The HomePod looks like an oversized toilet paper roll covered in mesh fabric. Apple said it can detect where its located in a room and adjust its sound accordingly.But unlike other companies, Apple is hesitant to open up its speaker to third-party developers. Although developers can make apps for Siri and HomePod, they're currently limited to building things like lists, notes, and messaging.HomePod will work with Apple's HomeKit platform to control smart-home devices. But voice control is designed to work only with Apple Music, the company's $10 a month subscription service. You can stream other services to it from a smartphone, but not with Siri.It's unclear why the product has been delayed, but it will miss the holiday rush. Luckily for Apple, its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 seem to be selling well enough.""Revenge porn will soon be a crime in New York CityNew York City has unanimously passed legislation that makes revenge porn a crime.The city council voted on Thursday to make it a misdemeanor to disclose, or to threaten to disclose, the intimate images of someone without their consent and with the intent to cause harm. The act will be punishable of up to 1 year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both.One in 8 Internet users in the U.S. has been a victim of non-consensual pornography, defined as the distribution of sexually graphic images of someone without his or her consent, according to a study from the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative.Currently, there is no federal revenge porn law, but 38 states and Washington D.C. have enacted laws against revenge porn. New York's state effort has been stalled.In 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill pertaining to unlawful surveillance, making it illegal to spread pictures or videos of someone engaged in sexual acts that was taken without consent.Related: To combat revenge porn, Facebook wants some users to send their intimate photosBut that doesn't protect those who've taken images of themselves naked, or in sexual acts, and sent them to a partner.New York City's bill aims to provide a ""very clear road map"" for civil courts, said Councilman Rory Lancman at a press conference ahead of the vote. Mayor Bill de Blasio supports the measure. Pending his signature, the civil portion is effective immediately; the criminal portion takes effect 60 days after becoming law.It does so by giving individuals explicit permission to seek an injunction, and the opportunity to seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys' fees, said Lancman. He introduced the bill with Councilman Dan Garodnick in 2016.""For years, prosecutors have been frustrated by our inability to effectively respond to a problem we see with increased regularity,"" said Eric Rosenbaum, assistant district attorney in Queens County, at Thursday's press conference. ""Special victims and computer crimes prosecutors across the city are hopeful that would-be offenders will now be deterred from engaging in this conduct.""Some advocates for a revenge porn law are unsure the new bill will be as effective as it intends to be. The ""intent to cause harm"" isn't always evident or provable in revenge porn cases, they say.""New Yorkers deserve a non-consensual porn criminal law ... and that protection should be regardless of the motives of the offender,"" said New York based attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in sexual harassment crimes.Goldberg said the law was a good start.""Even if the language leaves much to be desired and gives defense attorneys a lot of ways for their clients to escape liability, the bill does have excellent civil measures borrowed from our pending state bill that makes it so lawyers like I can sue if our clients are the victims of non-consensual porn,"" she said.Related: Australia takes on revenge pornLaws against online harassment, including revenge porn, are notoriously weak. For some victims, copyright law has been the only way to get their naked pictures off the Internet — meaning they need to copyright their naked bodies.The vast majority of non-consensual pornography impacts private citizens, but the issue has made headlines when celebrities have become victims. For example, news surfaced in March 2017 that an ex-boyfriend of actress Mischa Barton was shopping around sexually explicit photos of her. In June, Barton won her case. The court ordered her ex to hand over any explicit videos and images."
