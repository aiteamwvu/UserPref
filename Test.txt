"there is simply no credible way to address climate change without changing the way we get from here to there meaning cars trucks planes and any other gasguzzling forms of transportation that is why it is so heartening to see electric cars considered curios for the rich or eccentric or both not that long ago now entering the mainstreama slew of recent announcements by researchers auto companies and world leaders offer real promise first up a forecast by bloomberg new energy finance said that electric cars would become cheaper than conventional cars without government subsidies between 2025 and 2030 at the same time auto companies like tesla general motors and volvo are planning a slate of new models that they say will be not only more affordable but also more practical than earlier versions and officials in such countries as france india and norway have set aggressive targets for putting these vehicles to use and phasing out emissionspewing gasoline and diesel carsskeptics may see these announcements as wishful thinking after all just 11 percent of all cars sold globally in 2016 were electrics or plugin hybrids and many popular models still cost much more than comparable fossilfuel carsthe skeptics however have consistently been overly pessimistic about this technology electric cars face challenges yet they have caught on much faster than was thought likely just a few years ago there were two million of them on the world’s roads last year up 60 percent from 2015 according to the international energy agency the cost of batteries the single most expensive component of the cars fell by more than half between 2012 and 2016 according to the department of energy tesla has indicated that it can produce batteries for about 125 per kilowatthour researchers say the cost of electric cars will be at parity with conventional vehicles when battery prices reach 100 per kilowatthour which experts say is just a few years away electric cars are more efficient of course but they also require less maintenance which should make them cheaper to own over timethe potential environmental benefits of electric vehicles are huge the transportation sector accounts for 14 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and 27 percent of emissions in the united states moreover countries have found it much more difficult to reduce planetwarming gases from transportation than from power plants in america for example transportation emissions again regularly exceed those from the electricity sector for the first time since the late 1970s the switch to electric cars is good for the climate because petroleum vehicles produce more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than power plants fueled by natural gas according to the energy information administrationproponents say the growth of electric cars when combined with the surge in renewable energy sources like solar and wind could lead to big reductions in emissions over time these forces should also help reduce local air pollution in countries like china and india which is why their leaders are getting behind these technologies in a big way government incentives have turned china into the biggest market for electric vehicles and an indian government minister says his country wants all cars sold there by 2030 to be electric france says it wants to end sales of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2040 while norway’s goal is 2025government support could prove as crucial to the future of the technology as technical advances if countries states and localities encourage the spread of public charging stations through tax breaks other incentives or public spending more people will take the plunge and convert if the united states and other governments continue to spend money on research to help drive down battery costs their economies and consumers will benefitsome parts of the fossil fuel industry will no doubt try to sabotage the electric car revolution in the united states the industry is lobbying states to eliminate subsidies for the vehicles and many analysts expect the industry to seek similar changes at the federal level from president trump and republican leaders in congress who have already made clear that they do not see climate change as a major threat they should know though that the most they can do is slow down the process the electric car has already left the garage""electric cars are greener than gas literally everywherethere is however a caveati was going to write a post this morning about a study produced by advocacy group transport & environment that says electric cars produce fewer emissions everywhere in the european union even coaldependent poland i mean check out these eyepopping numbersthen i came across a just released study by michael sivak and brandon schoettle from the university of michigan that furthers this argument snappily titled fuel sources for electricity in the individual countries of the world and the consequent emissions from driving electric vehicles the study finds that electric cars produce fewer emissions than their gas powered equivalent in every country in the world even botswana and gibraltar which produce 100% of their electricity from coal and oil respectively but just how green they are varies a staggering amount heres how forbes reported on this studysince albania generates 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric power any ev on the roads there is a 5100mpg champ on the other end of the spectrum lies a country like botswana since it gets all of its electricity from coal and oil any electric vehicle there is like a 29mpg car a bit better than the average new vehicle in the us speaking of the united states the average ev here gets 554 mpgghgthat said a couple of things should be noted about this study it doesnt take into account emissions created during manufacturing which are higher for electric vehicles and it appears to be looking at average vehicle emissions—meaning small low range evs are being pitted against big fat suvswhich brings me to a rather over dramatized headline in the financial times electric cars green image blackens underneath the hood here the ft cites an mit study that finds large electric cars—like the tesla model s 100d— can produce 61115 kg of co2 equivalent over the course of 270000km of driving once manufacturing emissions are taken into account this is compared to 51891 for a small gaspowered car like the mitsubishi mirage thats assuming however that the car is driven in the relatively coaldependent us midwest and that the cars lifespans are the same a questionable assertion given the relative mechanical simplicity of an electric vehiclethe message here as the financial times itself points out is not that electric cars are dirtier than gas cars after all a bmw 7 series produced nearly twice the emissions of the tesla in the same study—and electric cars are always greener than equivalent sized nonelectric cars its that putting an electric drivetrain in an oversized car and giving it more range than it needs is not the greenest way to fix our transportation problems instead we need a multipronged approach that goes something like this1 switch all vehicles to electric drivetrains2 clean up the electrical grid so they run on renewables3 encourage the use of smaller vehicles with only as much range as is realistically needed4 promote ridesharing and alternatives to car ownership so manufacturing emissions are spread over a greater number of passenger miles5 rethink planning and transportation so that cars arent necessarynote this list was updated to include the importance of cleaning up the gridi write a lot about electric cars i drive two plugin vehicles they offer a significant improvement over their gas and dieselpowered equivalents but they are by no means a panaceawe can do better""converting seawater to fuel storing energy in salt and using robotics to drill geothermal wells these are all ideas that have gone through alphabets “moonshot factory named x formerly google x which builds and tests out prototypes in an attempt to address really big global problems like climate changeat the new york times climatetech conference on thursday in downtown san francisco the head of x astro teller detailed some of the internet giant’s most successful and most unsuccessful projects that relate to energy and reducing carbon emissionssome x projects were created specifically to fight climate change like the seawater idea others teller said will likely have the indirect effect of reducing emissions like google’s selfdriving car efforts which were once part of x but are now a separate division at alphabetteller  dubbed the captain of moonshots  is as gleeful about his teams failures as he is about the successes for example he related that he was quite pleased when he and a colleague quickly rejected an idea to harness energy from avalanches working through some of the crazier ideas and swiftly proving why they won’t work is a key part of the process at the google lab as teller describes ithe highlighted the seawater project called foghorn which google killed off two years after it was born because the group didn’t see how it could deliver alternative fuel economically “it’s one of the ones we’re most proud of that didn’t work” he saidfoghorn working with scientists at parc built technology that collected hydrogen and carbon dioxide from seawater and combined those ingredients to make a fuel used in engines the program was led by kathy cooper the colleague with whom teller hashed out the avalanche energy brain teasera new no 2 state for utility pv the upside of solar in florida“we were making vials of methane we were unbelievably excited about this” said telleralas as many entrepreneurs and investors have learned from the biofuels markets at the end of the day it’s all about the cost of making a gallon of fuel while the foghorn team originally thought they could make the seawater fuel for 5 to 6 per gallon of gasoline equivalent after two years the technology appeared to be closer to 15 per gallon at the same time the price of gasoline had dropped closer to 3 per galloncooper spearheaded winding down the project and published details about the technology in an effort to see if anyone outside of google could continue the work after the project closed cooper got a promotion and later went on to lead another x project teller said x has created a culture that enables researchers to take risks fail and move on to new ideasthe salt battery is an example of an x project that the lab took halfway to the finish line but now needs partners to complete said teller the technology called malta is based upon the work of stanford physics professor robert laughlin who created a model for storing thermal energy in molten salt with high efficiency“it’s like pumped hydro in a box” teller said malta is now looking for partners to help it build a “megawattscale” prototype plant large enough to test the technology at a commercial scalehowever it’s unclear what institution would be willing to put up the funds for such an unproven concept particularly since the cost of lithiumion batteries has dropped dramaticallyanother x project has focused on using robotics to build geothermal pipes to heat and cool homes this year the project was spun out into a separate company called dandelionteller described the technology behind dandelion as speeding up the process of drilling a geothermal system from several weeks to several hours “this is a real business but not one that x should be in” said teller explaining the spinoff cooper the former head of foghorn is now heading up that companyteller briefly touched on x’s highaltitude wind project which it acquired several years ago through the startup makani power while makani’s tech has appeared to struggle to be commercialized makani’s head fort felker told greentech media earlier this year that the company still remains committed to the technologyit’s easy to dismiss google’s moonshot climatechange work as irrational uneconomic and uninformed and it can be all of those thingsbut that’s not the point its an r&d lab developed by a wealthy company that can afford it and that inspires its workers and partners  google has no doubt had a much bigger effect on fighting climate change by spearheading corporate efforts to embrace clean energy the company has spent over 2 billion on using clean energy for its energyhungry data centers at the same time google has often acted as a customer for young energytech startups like bloom energy when it was first foundedbut the x lab is an effort to create something else entirely an environment that can birth new ideas and keep its talent engaged it’s understandable that many of them would naturally gravitate to trying to tackle climate change teller compared google’s moonshot lab to the work being done by breakthrough energy ventures a billiondollar venture led by bill gates john doerr vinod khosla and others to invest in energy research and developmentwith dwindling federal government support efforts to invest in innovative climate tech are becoming increasingly rare “two is not enough said teller referring to breakthrough and google x we need another ten""companies are realizing that renewable energy is good for businesswhen will individuals follow suit?the conservative city of georgetown texas runs on renewable energy after all wind and solar power are more predictable and easier to budget than oil and gas clean power pushes may be associated with more leftleaning cities but republican mayor dale ross called the switch to renewables a nobraineron november 14 joe brown editor in chief of popular science and ali velshi anchor at msnbc teamed up to discuss why going green is often more than the best ecological decision its often the best business decision toothe pair discussed natural disasters which cost taxpayers billions of dollars in 2017 at least 15 weather events cost the government more than a billion dollars each “the most expensive events we have in the us are floods” says velshi the money spent preparing for and preventing these events—by raising houses and bolting bookshelves—pays itself back double triple and even quadruple times over and as scientists continue to find evidence that climate change makes these storms worse its increasingly clear that the mitigation of global warming should be at the top of our list of preventative measuresbut companies and private citizens often fail to prepare properly because the money spent on prevention is private whereas costs after the fact are often allotted through government organizations like fema many fail to connect the cost of switching to renewable energy with the eventual savings of avoiding natural disasters “i think anyone who knows anything about science understands this is a problem” says velshi “but if you don’t live near the coast it may not register”on an even larger scale the costs of switching to renewable energy are larger up front though they save money in the future for example denmark struggled to store its wind power in a way that allowed them to save it for times of high electricity demand then they encouraged residents to buy electric cars now these vehicles act like moving batteries and people can sell the energy back to the grid when the cars are parked “they are giving people monetary incentives” says browncompanies that do right by the climate don’t just make more money over time they earn customer trust brown polled the audience to see who bought patagonia mountain gear because the company famously practices environmental conscientiousness many bought patagonia clothing for this reason ford and heineken are companies that most people don’t necessarily associate with green practices but that might soon change after the last fuel crisis in 2010 ford created f150s that are lighter and more energyefficient the company also hired the architect bill mcdonough to redesign the ford rouge center a manufacturing facility built on the wetlands of michigan ford wanted to clean up toxic stormwater and expand the plant now the roof is covered with plants that clean rainwater and moderate the temperature of the building“it’s not cheaper but once you get everybody bought in that this is your legacy these are your children this is your brand i’ll think that will be a turning point” says velshistill state and local governments such as mayor dale ross’s municipal government in georgetown texas have the most power to make longlasting changes in green energy they have the power to approve new building projects and hand out permits velshi calls for more conversation with civic leaders in addition to individual conscientiousness “go vote” says velshi “we all need to show up”""elon musk renewable energy largest ever lithiumion battery switched on in australiaelon musk’s giant lithiumion battery is now live in australia completed weeks ahead of schedule tesla has won

what we knowuber failed to disclose 2016 hackubers disclosure that hackers accessed the personal information of 57 million riders and drivers last year a breach it didnt disclose publicly until tuesday adds new potential legal woes for the already troubled companyat the time of the breach uber paid hackers 100000 to destroy the data and did not tell regulators or users that their information was stolenuber is trying to salvage its reputation following a number of highprofile controversies including using software called greyball to evade regulators a court battle over allegedly stolen secrets from googles selfdriving car division and a slew of complaints regarding sexual harassment and toxic company culturewhat happeneduber ceo dara khosrowshahi said two hackers broke into the company in late 2016 and stole personal data including phone numbers email addresses and names of 57 million uber users among those the hackers stole 600000 drivers license numbers of drivers for the companyrelated uber paid hackers 100000 after they stole data on 57 million userskhosrowshahi says hackers accessed the data through a thirdparty cloudbased service according to bloomberg they got into ubers github account a site many engineers and companies use to store code and track projects there hackers found the username and password to access uber user data stored in an amazon serverjeremiah grossman chief of security strategy at security firm sentinelone says this was not a sophisticated hack companies frequently accidentally keep credentials in source code that is uploaded to github he saidthe 100000 paymentinstead of alerting users and authorities to the breach as required by law uber paid the hackers 100000uber says it obtained assurances the data was destroyedlaw enforcement advises companies to not pay hackers and report breaches to the authoritiesaccording to andrea matwyshyn professor of law and computer science at northeastern university if companies help cyber criminals make money off hacks they will only continuethe problem with viewing this as some sort of simple risk management decision is that it underestimates the basis for an attackers business model matwyshyn told cnn tech it doesnt address the underlying problem in your own organization  your security practices need revision and youre failing to adequately protect your assets including your own proprietary information and your customers datapaying hackers to return data is common practice for instance its expected ransomware payments  paying hackers to unlock files after a cyberattack  will top 2 billion this year according to new research from cybersecurity firm bitdefenderubers payoff to prevent hackers from leaking the stolen data is more similar to recent extortion attempts on netflix and hbo than ransomware campaigns hackers threatened to release tv shows unless the companies paid them neither firm paid the extortionistsnew legal troublesmatwyshyn says its possible uber will face consequences from both state and federal agenciesfortyeight states have security breach notification laws which require companies to disclose when hackers access private information including california where uber is headquarteredstate attorneys general from new york and massachusetts have opened investigations into the data breachin washington dc senator richard blumenthal urged the federal trade commission to take action against the company and impose significant penaltiessenate commerce committee should hold hearing to demand uber explain their outrageous breach  and inexplicable delay in informing its consumers and drivers blumenthal a connecticut democrat said in a tweet on wednesdayan ftc spokesman said in a statement we are aware of press reports describing a breach in late 2016 at uber and uber officials actions after that breach we are closely evaluating the serious issues raisedin january uber agreed to pay 20 million to settle ftc charges it misled drivers about how much they could make using the platformthe company also settled ftc allegations that it made deceptive privacy and security claims in august a hacker accessed uber data on more than 100000 drivers in may 2014 further the ftc said uber did not properly monitor employee access to customer informationthe agency gave uber 180 days to obtain an independent audit into its privacy and security practices tuesdays data breach notification falls within that time frameinternational attentionother countries have similar rules regarding breaches the uks top data privacy organization slammed uber on wednesdayif uk citizens were affected then we should have been notified so that we could assess and verify the impact on people whose data was exposed james dipplejohnstone deputy commissioner of the information commissioners office said in a statement deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companiesthe office of the australian information and privacy commissioner said it was aware of the hack and had commenced inquiries with uberthe italian data protection authority said it assessing the scale of the breach we are dismayed by the poor transparency shown towards users which we intend to investigate authority president antonello soro said in a statementin the philippines the national privacy commission summoned local uber officials to a meeting on thursdayyet another data breachin terms of scale ubers hack doesnt measure up to other major breaches cyber criminals targeted equifax earlier this year compromising the personal information  including names addresses and social security numbers  of over 145 million people in 2013 a hack of yahoo impacted very single account  3 billion in totalformer executives from both of these companies have testified in front of congress in recent months regarding their security failures and the potential risks to consumersbut ubers breach is different  the company tried to cover it up and did not alert authorities or users of the issueconsumers might find this latest uber scandal more troubling than its other legal or public relations problems now that theyre the victims fiftyseven million people is a significant chunk of ubers user base which hit 40 million monthly active riders last yeargrossman says the breach may not change consumer behavior but it will be costly for the companyat best it will impact their bottom line the cost of dealing with this  theyre going to have lawsuits and legal fees grossman saidhe also said the disclosure helps get it out in the open so the company can begin moving toward repairing its reputationubers future planswhen khosrowshahi became ceo in august he inherited a slew of controversial problems in addition to its legal troubles uber has faced criticism for sexual harassment issues underpaying and deceiving drivers questioning a rape victim and surge pricing during times of crisisthe new ceo wants to improve ubers reputation and on tuesday said while i cant erase the past i can commit on behalf of every uber employee that we will learn from our mistakeskhosrowshahi said the company fired two individuals who led security response joe sullivan ubers chief security officer is no longer with the company it saidceo travis kalanick who was in charge when the hack took place is still on the companys board of directors while khosrowshahi is promising change kalanicks place in a leadership role serves as a reminder they are keeping someone who signed off on controversial issues tied to the companyuber is expected to go public in 2019""skype yanked from app stores in chinaxi jinpings rise to powerchina is cracking down on skypeapple

google pixel buds falls short of promisea trilingual chat with google pixel buds goes awrythe launch of another pair of wireless headphones isnt that excitingbut when google goog announced its new pixel buds in october touting the ability to translate a conversation between different languages in near real time it promised something uniquewith over 7000 languages spoken around the world the ease of wiping away language barriers with technology has obvious allure travelers could visit any country and instantly talk to locals it could help displaced populations connect with new communities jobs would become accessible to more people worldwidebut the pixel buds dont fulfill that promise at least not yetthe 159 bluetooth earbuds work with recent android and ios devices but the translation feature is specific to google pixel smartphoneswithout a pixel phone youre getting somewhat uncomfortable wireless headphones with decent sound quality and a hefty price taggoogle pixel budsto use the instant translate feature put on the headphones press and hold the right bud and say help me speak italian it fires up the google translate app and you hand your smartphone to the other personwhile wearing the earbuds you can say a phrase such as i love your hat where did you get it? the pixel phone will then translate the phrase out loud in italian using its builtin google assistantthe other person can press the microphone button on the pixel phone to speak a response in italian youll hear the english translation via the ear budsrelated googles pixelbook is a pretty ad for chromebookssince it launched over 11 years ago the free google translate site and app has grown to include more than 100 languages but only 40 are currently supported by pixel budsthe usual caveats of using a machine translation tool to communicate with someone still apply the results are typically close enough to make a conversation possible if you speak in clear sentences dont ramble and avoid idioms thats probably good advice for all conversationstranslations happen fast but background noise was a problem the pixel buds sometimes prematurely thought i was done talkingthe app shows the written translation on the phone screen  a helpful feature but overall the technology is not yet fluid enough to have long deep conversations about politics business or the meaning of life you will definitely be able to find the nearest restroomthe two black earbuds are connected to each other by a cord i prefer the cord to apples freefloating earpods but some people may find it to be too bulkythe adjustable loop of cord kept the pixel buds in place but the plastic buds themselves didnt fit comfortably into my ears because ears are not all the same shape an earbud thats uncomfortable for one person may fit perfectly for anothergoogles earbuds come in an attractive fabric case that doubles as a charging dock the earpieces dont click into place as easily as they should and you have to wind the cable around them each time leaving a loop hanging out apples earpods win on compact packaging and chargingfor pixel phone owners interested in translation the pixel buds are unquestionably a fun option but theyre not ready for professional level tasks if you only want them to listen to music and podcasts there are cheaper options available with similar or better sound qualityin the end its not worth buying a pixel phone specifically to get the pixel buds after all anyone can download the free google translate app on android or ios and get a similar experience""alibaba gobbles up stake in chinas walmartyou need an app to shop in alibabas grocery storesalibabas appetite for grocery stores shows no signs of letting upthe chinese ecommerce giant

posts scraped from social media news sites forums and other publicly available websites vickery told cnn tech the posts are in multiple languages and originate from countries across the world including the united statesthe information which vickery said goes back as far back as 2009 is held by us central command centcom and us pacific command pacom theres no indication that malicious attackers accessed the databases the defense department secured the data by october 1 after vickery alerted officials of the problem in midseptember he saidthe information that was exposed had been publicly available  it was not for instance sensitive user data still the failure to fully secure the data raises concerns about government cybersecurity practicesits a pretty serious leak when youre talking about intelligence information being stored in an amazon cloud service and not properly safeguarded said timothy edgar a former white house official in the obama administration and former us intelligence officialedgar said he frequently questioned the security and implementation of cloud technology while working in intelligence thats exactly what we were worried about he saidcloud computing allows a large organization like a government agency or business to readily access information stored on remote servers from farflung locations it is increasingly how data is storedthe defense department confirmed the exposure in an email to cnn techwe determined that the data was accessed via unauthorized means by employing methods to circumvent security protocols said maj josh jacques a spokesperson for us central command once alerted to the unauthorized access centcom implemented additional security measures to prevent unauthorized accesshow the data was discoveredamazon amzn tech30 servers where data is stored called s3 buckets are private by default private means only authorized users can access them for one to be made more widely accessible someone would have to configure it to be available to all amazon web services users but users would need to know or find the name of the bucket in order to access itby searching specific keywords vickery identifies information that companies and organizations inadvertently expose in this case he looked for buckets containing the word comthree s3 buckets were configured to allow anyone with an amazon web services account to access them they were labeled centcombackup centcomarchive and pacomarchive vickery saidlast week amazon introduced new s3 security features including displaying an indicator next to any bucket that is publicly accessiblerelated data of almost 200 million voters leaked onlinethis is not the first exposure of data vickery has discovered he previously found major leaks from verizon and a republican analytics firm both firms closed the security holes once alerted to the issuethe overall goal is to make people aware that data breaches and companies exposing data haphazardly is a huge epidemicsized problem vickery said if something of this size and importance suffers from the same problem we need to start taking it a lot more seriouslythis isnt the first time centcom experienced an online security failure in 2015 hackers took over the agencys twitter accountwhats insidethe data that was exposed includes information from twitter facebook and other public websitesthe posts originate from many countries and are written in different languages with an emphasis on arabic farsi and other central and south asian dialects spoken in afghanistan and pakistan according to vickery although the content goes back eight years the uploads appear to have begun in 2013 and were ongoing when vickery found the datavickery analyzed a small fraction of it posts included comments from youtube twitter and facebook local us websites that focus on sports and guns scam alert websites and forums containing offensive contentupguard vickerys firm shared some englishlanguage posts with cnn techtopics included american history president trump former presidential candidate hillary clinton killer clowns russia former president obama russian president vladimir putin american pop stars and the popeinside one centcom data bucket is a folder labeled outpost vickerys analysis indicates the folder contains information from a thirdparty contractor called vendor x this company no longer has an active presence onlineaccording to the linkedin profile of erik kjell berg former vice president of product at vendor x outpost is a multilingual social analytics platform designed to positively influence change in highrisk youth in unstable regions of the world built exclusively for the dept of defenseberg and other former executives for vendor x did not respond to requests for commentjacques the spokesperson for us central command said centcom has used commercial offtheshelf and webbased programs for information gathering the information we gather is widely available to anyone who conducts similar online activities he saidwhat the data is used forthe purpose of the data collection effort is not clearjacques said it is used for measurement and engagement activities of our online programs on public sites he declined to elaborate although he said it is not collected nor processed for any intelligence purposesedgar worked in the office of the director of national intelligence under president george w bush and later advised president obama on privacy and cybersecurity issueshe said the rules around opensource information gathering by government agencies remain at least partly unclearthere have been continuing question marks about the role of collecting publicly available information from social media he said government intelligence officers say we shouldnt inhibit ourselves when were talking about collecting information about potential terrorists if the rules allow it we should do it but that kind of approach can get problematic because it doesnt offer a whole lot of guidanceanother expert andrea little limbago chief social scientist at cybersecurity firm endgame said its not uncommon for the pentagon to collect vast sums of internet dataat times you do need to cast a wide net and then do the analytics to narrow down what youre trying to find said limbago a former analyst with the defense department between 2007 and 2011she said she would be surprised if the defense department was targeting us individuals without the proper authorization""in berkeleys cyberwar class students become hackersa new class at the university of california berkeley is training students to hackthe class called cyberwar teaches its 80 students how to find security flaws in the apps and websites people use every dayi mostly focused on government websites specifically voter registration websites said vyan phan a junior studying electrical engineering and computer science whos enrolled in the classduring class assignments she discovered vulnerabilities in at least five sites that could potentially be used to trick someone into registering incorrectlywhat i found was state websites and local websites were usually extremely poorly run she told cnn tech if i can find bugs certainly someone else cantwice a week students pour into berkeleys hewlett packard auditorium to learn how nationstate actors and cybercriminals hack into computer systems by learning their methods they can learn to try and stop themin addition to government sites students have also uncovered vulnerabilities in various apps including from one a bank and shopping sites one student made 100 after reporting a bug to the companyrelated malware researcher helps teen hackers turn skills into careersdoug tygar the computer science professor who teaches the class calls it an experimentthe goal is to train students to build super secure systems tygar told cnn tech after a class but in order to do that they have to be able to think like a hackerthe class works with hackerone a hackerforhire platform every bug a student finds is reported to the company or organization where it was found companies on the hackerone platform pay hackers who find bugs in their systems most students target the companies that use the platformstudents also hear lectures and attend events hosted in partnership with hackerone to learn from professional hackersrelated hackers will work with government academia to make future elections secureunless you have the skill of being able to think like a hacker youre not going to be able to build secure systems tygar saidthe cyberwar class wont be offered next semester but tygar plans to teach it again in the future and he intends to change the namemeanwhile ted kramer chief of staff at hackerone said the company wants to bring the program to more campusesthe class could help prepare students for future employment according to a report from cybersecurity ventures there will be 35 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide by 2021phan ultimately wants a job in security testing to help companies keep apps websites and

support and donations at its second annual social good forumone new feature connects mentors and mentees together through a program created by nonprofit organizations the pilot project will include imentor a high school mentoring program and the international rescue committee which focuses on crisis recoveryfacebook fb tech30 said it wants to eventually expand the feature and include other areas such as addiction recovery and career advancementuntil now facebook has been focused on helping you connect with people you already know but it might be just as important to help you connect with someone outside your social circle who can provide a new source of support and inspiration ceo mark zuckerberg said on stage at the eventrelated facebook continues craigslist takeover with housing rentalsfacebooks forum held in new york city comes amid criticism over russian propaganda and fake news stories spreading on its platform during the us presidential election last yearearlier this month the social networks general counsel testified before congress about russian meddling on the platform it recently announced a portal that lets users see whether they liked or followed accounts associated with russian propagandaat wednesdays forum facebook made other announcements including the elimination of fees for nonprofits and that 100% of donations made through the platform will go directly to groups it also unveiled a 50 million facebook donations fund to help communities with disaster recovery via direct donations and matching contributionswhen i started facebook i wasnt thinking about it as a way to raise money to fight diseases zuckerberg saidbut the company noticed people were raising money for a variety of causes on the platform he addedthe sites giving tools such as personal fundraisers and nonprofit donate buttons will now also be expanded to europe australia canada and new zealandfacebook is also expanding its blood donation tool to bangladesh early next year it first launched the feature in india which is another country in greater need of blood donors in octoberpeople were already using facebook for blood donation and fundraising were building tools to make it even easier naomi gleit facebook vp of social good told cnn techrelated facebook is rolling out aibased suicide prevention effortearlier this week the company announced it would expand its automated effort to help prevent suicidethese tools come after facebook changed its mission this summer from connecting people to giving the people the power to build community and bring the world closer togetherbeing seen as an altruistic company has its advantages especially with younger people who are more likely to associate with companies who share their values according to chris mcclean vice president at research firm forrestercompanies that are showing theyre strong on values and authentic  are gaining trust and loyalty of consumers this eventually of course translates to revenue but they have to be authentic with those values first he saidhowever facebooks biggest potential risk is that it comes off disingenuous with these effortspeople very quickly identify companies that make a big pr or marketing splash but dont follow it up with investment mcclean said""amazons wish lists are changing the way we donateholidays are hard for the mothers incarcerated at logan correctional center in illinoisbut for the fourth year in a row hundreds of the women will be able to pick out and wrap presents to hand to their children thanks in part to amazon wish listsgift giving is a simple thing that every parent wants to be able to do for their child but its something incredibly difficult for mothers who are incarcerated to do said holly krig the director of organizing for moms united against violence & incarcerationmoms united runs an annual gift drive for mothers in seven local correctional institutions including logan instead of the typical toy drive anyone who wants to help can send gifts directly to the prisons from an amazon wish listthe amazon tool allows users to create a list of items they want most and others can access it for giftgiving ideas or to make a purchase they were originally designed for baby and wedding registries or individual birthday requestsbut there has been an uptick in organizations using amazon wish lists in the last year according to charity navigator a group that rates charitiesafter hurricane harvey multiple organizations in texas used the tool to get goods on the ground theres a list to buy hand warmers and socks for the homeless another to send books and movies to unaccompanied immigrant children who are detained in virginia and maryland the aspca has multiple lists including one for animals affected by recent natural disasters and another just for foster kittensmoms united chicagocharities are setting up amazon wish lists to get donations sent exactly where they need thempeople tend to prefer giving something concrete and its easier to visualize or imagine what the impact is when its something specific said krig people enjoy picking toys and imagining kids receiving thingsby engaging people where theyre already doing the bulk of their online shopping the lists eliminate major barriers to donating amazon prime has an estimated 90 million members in the us these users are potential donors who wont need to enter payment information slog through an unfamiliar interface or pay for most shipping using amazons lists for donations is a bit of a hackamazon doesnt have settings or options specifically for nonprofits or large groups such as verification the company didnt reply to a request for commentmanaging a list takes a lot of work according to krig and she has deep concerns about the companys labor practices but amazons large inventory makes it easy to find gifts that meet the prisons security standards the prisons also specifically request donations be shipped directly from amazon which is considered a trusted sourcecharitable giving experts usually recommend giving cash instead of goods however wish lists can ensure a charity only gets what it requiresunlike the wellintentioned but misguided collections that can happen after a natural disaster  wish lists are created by the nonprofit so donors know they are fulfilling a nonprofit need said katherina rosqueta executive director of the center for high impact philanthropy at the university of pennsylvaniapotter park zoo amazonthe potter park zoo in lansing michigan knew that ulana the african lion needed a giant blue ball the toy was donated through the amazon wish list the zoo has managed for five years the list specifies what animal gets an item so you know fake grass rugs go to penguins and that a mongoose will enjoy the plastic easter eggseven when using a wish list is an option giving money can still be a more effective way of helping those in need cash donations are easier to manage and give organizations more flexibilitywish lists are probably not the most efficient way to help nonprofits and their beneficiaries many nonprofits have partnerships that allow them to buy items they need in bulk at a better rate than donors might get on amazon said rosquetafor moms united against violence and incarceration the annual drive is as much about connecting moms and kids as it is raising awarenessits an opportunity to talk about the underlying issues and why we have to have these campaigns at all said krig""a school lord &

shopperstwo years ago a few ucla undergraduate students invented a pocketsized phone charger called flux they sold it on street corners in santa monicaflux became a hit so they started accepting online orders they packaged and shipped them out to customers from a fraternity houseit wasnt the greatest condition for running a business especially in terms of just cleanliness so thats when we decided to outsource distribution said flux cofounder miles anthonynow flux chargers are sold between 30 and 50 at b8ta a retail store with eight locations in the usthe tech gadget store is betting on a new kind of business model instead of taking a percentage of any profits it charges hardware makers a flat fee to display their product for example flux pays 2000 a month for placement in multiple storesin exchange b8ta collects data on show shoppers interact with productsits san francisco store has 24 stereoscopic cameras monitoring visitors sales and browsing habits the cameras are clearly visible throughout the store and the data collected is anonymous the company saidalthough some retailers already track shopper behavior b8ta has folded it into how it does business the gadget makers get updates with how many impressions discoveries demos and sales their products have receivedrelated amazon wants you to shop for black friday in augmented reality b8ta storeanother goal of the store is to educate shoppers about products in fact b8ta doesnt even care if you buy the items somewhere elseif you want to buy this on amazon thats ok said b8tas cofounder phillip raub were not threatened by that at allinside the space looks like an apple stores moodier cousin b8ta stores are open and minimalist with lines of products available to touch and test an ipad mini sits next to each gadget and displays product information about itb8tas inventory is a mix of useful and kitschy technology not unlike what youd find in a brookstone or sharper image there are wifi speakers security cameras electric bikes and connected home devices if youre looking for something unusual try the floss dispenser that frowns when you go too long without flossing or the fondoodler cheesedispensing hotglue guna spot in a real brickandmortar store wouldnt be possible for many of these companies the majority of gadgets come from startups founded by people who whipped up a hit kickstarter campaignwhere else would they have the opportunity to bring their hardware into a store? said vibhu norby another of b8tas cofoundersfounded in 2015 the company wants to position itself as the next trend in retail an industry currently undergoing big changes traditional stores are closing at an alarming rate retail stocks are struggling and some companies are going bankrupt b8ta sees the shifts more as an opportunity than a warningwere sick and tired of saying retails dead said norby its too important of an industry to just write off and say its deadrelated the future of getting dressed ai vr and smart fabricsmeanwhile online sales are increasing fueled by companies like amazon but retail will survive because theres no way to recreate the emotional experience of a demo according to b8tas founders you cant tell how a product feels in your hand or hear the quality of a highend speaker over the internetits quite clear that a whole host of legacy players are becoming increasingly irrelevant said mark cohen director of retail studies at columbias graduate school of business there is no shortage of customers and most have plenty of disposable income and/or access to consumer credit they will most definitely continue to shop for their needs and wants they just arent shopping at their ubiquitous local macys or jc penney anymoreone way those legacy retailers are trying stay relevant is by partnering with b8ta the company has struck deals with established chains like lowes and macys to open ministores inside their existing locationsfor fluxs anthony its one less thing to worry about he said the entire production process for his chargers is automated — he doesnt even see the product anymore flux chargers are manufactured in china and shipped directly to a distribution company in austin that stores and ships the inventorythe vast majority of fluxs sales currently happen on amazoncom but a retail spot still has its allurewe got into a pretty cool tech store said anthony it really validated our whole business and product""apples homepod speaker delayed until next yearwatch out echo apple announces homepod speakerif you were hoping to buy a

it will ship early next year the company told cnn techapple homepod will be its first big new hardware product since the apple watchthe tech giant announced the speaker in june at its annual developer conference although siri was early to the voice assistant party the company is late to the smart speaker trend amazon invented the category in 2015 with the echo and there are now similar options available from google microsoft and sonosat 329 homepod was poised to be one of the pricier smart speakers on the market but it touts superior sound quality amazons echo line starts at 50 a google home mini costs 49 but the company is also coming out with a higherend version for 399we cant wait for people to experience homepod apples breakthrough wireless speaker for the home but we need a little more time before its ready for our customers apple said in a statement well start shipping in the us uk and australia in early 2018related smart speaker 101smart speakers use always listening microphones to detect commands then talk back with a smart assistant such as siri or alexa they can play music spit out trivia manage shopping lists and put things on your calendarthe homepod looks like an oversized toilet paper roll covered in mesh fabric apple said it can detect where its located in a room and adjust its sound accordinglybut unlike other companies apple is hesitant to open up its speaker to thirdparty developers although developers can make apps for siri and homepod theyre currently limited to building things like lists notes and messaginghomepod will work with apples homekit platform to control smarthome devices but voice control is designed to work only with apple music the companys 10 a month subscription service you can stream other services to

to disclose or to threaten to disclose the intimate images of someone without their consent and with the intent to cause harm the act will be punishable of up to 1 year in prison a 1000 fine or bothone in 8 internet users in the us has been a victim of nonconsensual pornography defined as the distribution of sexually graphic images of someone without his or her consent according to a study from the cyber civil rights initiativecurrently there is no federal revenge porn law but 38 states and washington dc have enacted laws against revenge porn new yorks state effort has been stalledin 2014 governor andrew cuomo signed a bill pertaining to unlawful surveillance making it illegal to spread pictures or videos of someone engaged in sexual acts that was taken without consentrelated to combat revenge porn facebook wants some users to send their intimate photosbut that doesnt protect those whove taken images of themselves naked or in sexual acts and sent them to a partnernew york citys bill aims to provide a very clear road map for civil courts said councilman rory lancman at a press conference ahead of the vote mayor bill de blasio supports the measure pending his signature the civil portion is effective immediately the criminal portion takes effect 60 days after becoming lawit does so by giving individuals explicit permission to seek an injunction and the opportunity to seek compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorneys fees said lancman he introduced the bill with councilman dan garodnick in 2016for years prosecutors have been frustrated by our inability to effectively respond to a problem we see with increased regularity said eric rosenbaum assistant district attorney in queens county at thursdays press conference special victims and computer crimes prosecutors across the city are hopeful that wouldbe offenders will now be deterred from engaging in this conductsome advocates for a revenge porn law are unsure the new bill will be as effective as it intends to be the intent to cause harm isnt always evident or provable in revenge porn cases they saynew yorkers deserve a nonconsensual porn criminal law  and that protection should be regardless of the motives of the offender said new york based attorney carrie goldberg who specializes in sexual harassment crimesgoldberg said the law was a good starteven if the language leaves much to be desired and gives defense attorneys a lot of ways for their clients to escape liability the bill does have excellent civil measures borrowed from our pending state bill that makes it so lawyers like i can sue if our clients are the victims of nonconsensual porn she saidrelated australia takes on revenge pornlaws against online harassment including revenge porn are notoriously weak for some victims copyright law has been the only way to get their naked pictures off the internet — meaning they need to copyright their naked bodiesthe vast majority of nonconsensual pornography impacts private citizens but the issue has made headlines when celebrities have become victims for example news surfaced in march 2017 that an exboyfriend of actress mischa barton was shopping around sexually explicit photos of her in june barton won her case the court ordered her ex to hand over any explicit videos and images"
